Lab Status

Answer the following questions by put a "x" in the bracket.
- Yes [X], No []: Complete pre-lab
- Yes [X], No []: Complete basic lab requirements
- Yes [X], No []: Complete something cool
  - If you have completed something cool, give it a short summary below: <br>
  This something cool is the same as Lab 1 where the button pauses and resumes the blinking of the LED. 


Answers to Pre-lab Questions
-------
This part is required only if you are requested to write your answers here. 

* Question 1: Why is RCC_AHB2ENR defined as 0x4C? Hints: Look at the RCC_TypeDef structure
defined in stm32l476xx.h. <br>
0x4C is the address offset from the start of the struct.


* Question 2: Learn from the example above, and translate the following C code into assembly:<br>
GPIOA->ODR |= GPIO_ODR_ODR_5; <br>

LDR r1, =GPIO_BASE <br>
LDR r3,[r1,#GPIO_ODR] <br>
ORR r3,r3,#GPIO_ODR_ODR_5 <br>
STR r3,[r1,#GPIO_ODR] <br>


Answers to After-lab Questions
-------

* Question 1: When loading the pointer value into r1, we use = to do a PC-relative load from a value in
the literal area. Why canâ€™t we specify a 32-bit immediate target to a move instruction like
the following? <br>
MOV r0, #0xdeadbeef <br>
The value is too large to fit in the instruction. The equals sign puts the value in reach so the assembler can do PC-relative loading.


* Question 2: In the example code, we ORR with an immediate constant pre-pended with #. What would
happen if your immediate constant did not fit? How could you work around that issue? <br>
Load the constant into a register with '=' then orr with that register.

* Question 3: How does the CMP instruction differ from the SUB instruction?<br>
CMP doesn't store the result of the subtraction operation.

* Question 4: Can we use the BIC instruction to turn off LED? If not, why? If so, how? <br>
Yes because BIC can wipe its own bits. It cannot really turn the LED back on but that is not the requirement.<br>
LDR r0, =GPIOA_BASE <br>
LDR r1, [r0, #GPIO_ODR] <br>
BIC r1, r1, #(F'<<'LED_PIN) <br>
The apostrophes are unnecessary for the code markdown just didn't like the symbols out in the open.

Lab Credits

Did you received any help from someone other than the instructor and lab teaching assistants?<br>
Blake Knedler and I helped each other troubleshoot and brainstorm.
