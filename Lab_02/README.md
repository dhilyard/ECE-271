Lab Status

Answer the following questions by put a "x" in the bracket.
- Yes [X], No []: Complete pre-lab
- Yes [X], No []: Complete basic lab requirements
- Yes [X], No []: Complete something cool
  - If you have completed something cool, give it a short summary below: 
	For something cool I made it so that the blue button swaps between clockwise and counter clockwise rotation. I used the button instead of the keypad as I didn't have the wires to hookup the keypad at the time.


Answers to Pre-lab Questions
-------
This part is required only if you are requested to write your answers here. 

* Question 1: Is the highest update frequency of half-stepping higher than that of full-stepping?

	Yes I found that half-stepping had a higher frequency as the steps inbetween movements allow for it to adjust without catching. My results found it to work with about half the delay of full-step.


Answers to After-lab Questions
-------

* Question 1: The Darlington array can only provide 500 mA of current. What could you use instead of the Darlington array if you need a larger current?

	Increasing sets of resistors relative to the amount you need to handle, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 etc. These arrays will keep the same resistance because of being in parallel but can support far more current.


* Question 2: Is it possible to rotate the motor in less than 1/2 step?

	Yes using PWM you can perform micro-stepping which rotates in smaller increments than 1/2, this adjusts the electrical current dynamically to make the rotation of the shaft less noticeable.


Suggestions and Comments
-------

* Do you have comments or suggestions for the lab and course?
Not at this time.

* Do you have comments or suggestions for the textbook and lab handouts? Any typos or errors?
Not at this time.


Lab Credits
-------
Did you received any help from someone other than the instructor and lab teaching assistants?
As with last time Zach Holm, Blake Knedler and I helped each other to troubleshoot and brainstorm.
