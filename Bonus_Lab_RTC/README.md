Lab Description
-------
Also called Bonus Lab 5 this lab is making a digital clock on the LCD that utilizes the on-chip RTC (Real Time Clock). This lab primarily took material from within the textbook to learn how the RTC worked but doesn't pull on functions made in my other labs. The clock is programmed at 11:32 to show digits at non 0 times and will continuously update the on screen display.
