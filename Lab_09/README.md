##  Lab Report ##

What is something cool you did in this lab?
-----------
Your answer: I controlled the speed of the stepper motor using the potentiometer and the SysTick method we used in Lab 7 to control the stepper motor.


Post-lab Questions
-------

* Answers to Question 1: Find VRef. <br>
Set the potentiometer to near the middle and measure the voltage on the PA1 pin with a voltmeter: 1.75V <br>
In the debug environment, find the value of the ADC DR register: 2114 <br>
Calculate what the reference voltage must be in order to fit the previous two values you measured: 3.39V <br>

* Answers to Question 2: The LED is turned off when the output from the potentiometer-based voltage divider is lower than 1.0V. What constant value should the ADC DR register be compared with?<br>
The measured value of the ADC DR register at 1.0V is 1181. <br>

* Answers to Question 3: The LED lights up when the voltage output from the potentiometer-based voltage divider is higher than 2.0V.  What constant value should the ADC DR register be compared with? <br>
The value of the DR Register for 2.0V is 2430.
